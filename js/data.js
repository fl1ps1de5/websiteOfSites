        brief: `A github repo which contains a script that can basically download any version of any Adobe app (for free!).
        Really cool command-line app, and really useful. It does require AdobeZii \n to patch the file though, and also
        you need to delete adobe creative cloud off your device and download a version 5.7.0.1307. Adobe Zii can be found online.`

        brief: `A bunch of fun, interesting puzzles, which run in the browser. 
        Some pretty out of the box games too. All hosted on an old school, low-effort website, which adds 
        to the charm.   I say "low-effort", but the actual coding for some of the games seems like it would be
        pretty nutty (look at the shape options in Cube)`
