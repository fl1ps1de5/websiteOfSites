        Some pretty out of the box games too. All hosted on an old school, low-effort website, which adds 
        to the charm.   I say "low-effort", but the actual coding for some of the games seems like it would be
        pretty nutty (look at the shape options in Cube)`

        brief: `This is a really cool little website. Its basically a quiz where you and an AI LLM have to work together to 
        submit the answer to various questions. Some are hard for humans and easy for the AI, and some are the other way around
        Does a good job at showing the weaknesses of AI, and its pretty fun.`
