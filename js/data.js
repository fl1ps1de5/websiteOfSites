        brief: `A github repo which contains a script that can basically download any version of any Adobe app (for free!).
        Really cool command-line app, and really useful. It does require AdobeZii \n to patch the file though, and also
        you need to delete adobe creative cloud off your device and download a version 5.7.0.1307. Adobe Zii can be found online.`
